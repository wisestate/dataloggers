 Configuration of the Raspberry Pi:
1.	Configure ‘config.csv’ with:
	a. FTP servers where it has to connect (up to 2)
	b. Modbus addresses it has to connect to
2. Execute 'python3 ftpPush.py' to make sure the software runs correctly
3. If the does, configure cron to execute the file periodically:
	a. Create folder logs (!)
    b. Execute command:
    	# 'crontab -e'. It will ask to create new file (press enter)
    c. Add line to the file:
        */15 * * * * /home/pi/dataCollecting/launcher.sh >/home/pi/dataCollecting/logs/cronlog.log

        (The addresses should match the location of the files)
4. The program should run every fifteen minutes after reboot. The output can be seen doing 'cat /home/pi/dataCollecting/logs/cronlog.log'
